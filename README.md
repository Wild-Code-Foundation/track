# Wild Code Track
A very simple visualisation tool for conservation managers to view their sensors on a map. Integrate any provider so 
park management can view it on a single page. LoRaWAN, Sat, GSM, AWT, ACT, Savanna, SpiderTracks, etc etc. Not limited to any kind of sensor or any provider.

## Features
### Add sensor
Simnple way to add new sensor. Only needs UID.

### Search sensors

### Create groups for sensors
Sensors can be grouped

### Add users
Add users that can also view your data

### USers to see sensors/groups 
Give users rights to view only certain groups or all

### Set home location
Set  home location where default map is loaded with set location and zoom level

### Draw boundaries
Simple drawing of shapes, park boundaries etc
Import files such as GeoJSON to draw boundary

### Draw geofences
Same as above but for geofences
Import files such as GeoJSON to draw boundary

### Alerts
Set alerts for sensors, example breaking geofence, battery low, threashold lows (IF THIS THEN THAT)

## Architecture
ReactJS frontend
Hasura backend
NodeRED for integrations and "API"
API needs token to allow updating sensor.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
